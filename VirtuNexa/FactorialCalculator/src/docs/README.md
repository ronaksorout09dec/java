Factorial Calculator Application Documentation
Overview
The Factorial Calculator is a Java application designed to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer using both iterative and recursive methods. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. This application serves as an educational tool for understanding factorial calculations and demonstrates key programming concepts such as recursion, loops, and user input handling.

Key Features

Iterative Method: Calculates factorial using loops.
Recursive Method: Calculates factorial using recursion.
User Input Handling: Validates user input to ensure it is a non-negative integer.
BigInteger Support: Uses BigInteger to handle large numbers beyond the limits of primitive data types.
Console-Based Interface: Provides a simple text-based interface for user interaction.
